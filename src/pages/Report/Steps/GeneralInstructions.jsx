        We appreciate your time and effort in providing information about the diving incident and
        the results of our data collection and analysis may be made public for the benefit of our
        community. DAN (Divers Alert Network), with your help, has maintained a diving incident
        database since 1989. Originally, it was limited to scuba diving incidents. This online
        reporting system is designed to include a variety of incidents including breath-hold diving,
        rebreather diving, accidents and incidents that happened outside of the water.

        The incident collection instrument is divided into sections, each with a series of
        questions. The time required to complete the sections will vary with the amount of detail
        available and the complexity of the case. Each section will be saved automatically when you
        click “Continue”. After saving a page, you will automatically be sent to the next one. You
        will be able to move forward and backward through the pages to make any necessary changes
        until you click “Done” on the final page. At that time, you will no longer be able to return
        to the case. Please contact specialprojects@dansa.org if you have questions or issues
        concerning this process.
