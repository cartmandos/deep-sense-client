        The incident collection instrument is divided into sections, each with a series of
        questions. The time required to complete the sections will vary with the amount of detail
        available and the complexity of the case. Each section will be saved automatically when you
        click “Continue”. After saving a page, you will automatically be sent to the next one. You
        will be able to move forward and backward through the pages to make any necessary changes
        until you click “Done” on the final page. At that time, you will no longer be able to return
        to the case.
